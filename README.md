Homework assignment 03 for Data Bootcamp, completed by James Lilley. 


## PyBank
My code can successfully open, read and loop through csv, putting each piece of information into separate lists. 
The list of amounts is stored and looped through to calculate the change between each result. After this, the average is calculate and the results are printed to the user. An identical csv. file is made with this information as well. 

## PyPoll
My code opens and reads the csv, making a "votebox" list and a candidates as a set. The set is then used against the votebox to create a dictionary of results. ;
At this point, the dictionary is sorted by its values (descending) so that the the printed list of results is shown from most to least votes and stored in a csv.
